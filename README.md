# Sober Selector

Sober selector automates the process of assigning sober monitors for social events.

## Key Features
1. Allows exemption of members from sobering for a single event.
2. Updates each member's total sober count and most recent sober date.
3. Records all sober assignments from past events, can be reviewed later.

## Roster Updates
The `members.csv` file contains the full roster of brothers and pledges (current as of June 2022). At the beginning of each semester, update this file with new pledges and switch the status of outgoing pledges to brothers.

The "status" column has 3 possible values:

`e` - long term exemption (ie: already sobered for 3 semesters)

`b` - brother eligible to sober

`p` - pledge eligible to sober
